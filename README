Students Organizing Against Pollution
=====================================

Students Organizing Against Pollution (SOAP) is an initiative aimed at empowering the average citizen of New Jersey with the ability to learn, share, and/or contribute knowledge pertaining to pollution in the environment. Find pollution sites near you and take action. Our pollution data comes directly from the US Environmental Protection Agency (www.epa.gov/). More specifically, we use data from the Toxics Release Inventory. Information regarding politicans and legislation is provided by the New Jersey State Government (http://www.nj.gov/).

The platforms and technologies that have been incorporated into SOAP include:
- HTML5 / CSS3
- JavaScript
- PHP5
- PostgreSQL
- CakePHP
- Twitter Bootstrap
